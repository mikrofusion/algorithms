Merge Sort
Complexity:  O(nlogn)

Algorithm:
Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

Run the code:
./merge_sort 5 7 8 2 1 3 4 6 9 10
