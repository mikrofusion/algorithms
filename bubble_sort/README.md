Bubble Sort
Complexity:
  Best: O(n) - when list is already sorted
  Worst: O(n^2) - list sorted in reverse order
  Average: O(n^2)

Sorts a list by iterating through and comparing each pair of elements in an array.  If the pair is out of order it will swap their positions.
It continues this iteration through the list until no swaps are performed.
